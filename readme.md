# Mac OS UI in Svelte
This is a programming exercise to try and recreate as much of Mac OS' UI functionality within Svelte, CSS and normal Javascript as I can. It is not intended for anything other than messing around and obviously all the rights to Mac OS, apple and any other trademarks or copyrighted materials belong to apple. I claim no rights to these parts of the project.
